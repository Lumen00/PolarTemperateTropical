This model built in fastai week 2 attempts to differentiate
between the three zones of polar, tropical, and temperate
around the world using images. This model is not wholly
effective, but was used as a starting point to understand
model deployment using Gradio, HuggingFace Spaces, GitHub
Pages and FastAI.
